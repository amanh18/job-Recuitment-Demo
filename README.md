A demo version of the home page for the recruitment startup, along with two backend features

Reference Website: LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/)

Frontend Home Page:

Header Section:

The header will contain the startup's logo and navigation menu.
The navigation menu will have options like "Home," "Find Jobs," "Post Jobs," "About Us," "Contact," etc.
Include a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button for employers to "Post Jobs" and for job seekers to "Find Jobs."
Hero Section:

A large, attractive banner image displaying diverse professionals to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
A brief and impactful tagline describing the startup's mission, such as "Connecting Top Talent with Global Opportunities."
Job Search:

Provide a job search bar where job seekers can enter keywords, job titles, or skills to find relevant job listings.
Include a dropdown menu to select job categories like "Software Engineers," "Product Managers," "Data Scientists," etc.
Add a location field to search for jobs in specific cities or regions.
Featured Job Listings:

Displaying the success stories of both employers and job seekers will add value to the platform.
Backend Features (for demonstration purposes):

Implement a backend job search functionality that allows users to search for jobs based on keywords, location, and job categories.
Create a filtering mechanism to refine search results, making it easier for job seekers to find relevant opportunities.




























I apologize for any confusion caused. Indeed, there's more to building a complete and production-ready recruitment startup website.
